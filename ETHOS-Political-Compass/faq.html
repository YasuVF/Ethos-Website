  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions About The Test</h1>

  <h2>What is the ETHOS test?</h2>
  <p>The ETHOS test maps your political ideology across three dimensions: Economic (your views on economy and ownership), Authority (your willingness to use force and trust in the establishment), and Adherence (your stance on traditional versus relativistic codes of conduct). The goal is to provide a more accurate, unbiased, and detailed result compared to standard 2D models.</p>

  <h2>Is the ETHOS test biased?</h2>
  <p>While it's nearly impossible to eliminate all biases, the ETHOS test strives to minimize them. By consolidating insights from various sources and writings, we aim to create the most unbiased version possible.</p>

  <h2>Why do we only ask about policy?</h2>
  <p>While many interesting questions exist outside of policy, political identity is rooted in politics and its policies. We aim to measure responses with meaningful implications, not those designed merely to provoke reactions or thought-provoking answers.</p>
  
  <h2>Is the ETHOS test 100% accurate?</h2>
  <p>Of course not! This test focuses on the 8 major political identities, but each has subcategories. For example, you might be labeled a libertarian, but if you're near the center (with low deviation from 0), you might be better described as a libertarian-leaning centrist. While we strive for accuracy, it's impossible to achieve 100% precision with a test like this.</p>

  <h2>Why would I trust this test over others?</h2>  
  <p>You shouldn't blindly trust the results. ETHOS is not a definitive test; it's a guideline that cuts through the complexity of politics as best as we can. If you have doubts, please visit the explanation page for a detailed breakdown of each position and the reasoning behind its placement. From there, you can better assess whether you agree or disagree. Additionally, if you find any discrepancies, we welcome corrections and will continue improving our products and services to ensure clear political standards.<p>
  
  <h2>Where would (x) politican be?</h2>
  <p>While we can infer the positions of politicians and public figures, we prefer direct results to avoid compounded biases that could skew outcomes. We reference some figures, but modern politicians will be excluded. If a politician takes the test and shares their results, we'll gladly use them. Until then, we refrain from making assumptions about current figures and avoid relying on former ones.</p>  

  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions About ETHOS Definitions</h1>

  <h2>Where do you get your definitions?</h2>
  <p>We base our definitions on literature, historical examples, and the underlying philosophy of each term. We aim to understand the ideas and nuances behind the language used and how these concepts function. Since many terms are complex and vary in meaning, we consolidate all available sources to define them as accurately as possible.</p>

  <h2>Why do your definitions differ from how people use these terms online or in media?</h2>
  <p>People often use terms in ways that support their arguments, especially in the fast-paced world of the internet. We’re not trying to win debates or prove a point—we simply aim to be accurate and truthful. Our focus is on the nuanced history, literature, and philosophy behind each term, not on popular usage.</p>
  
  <h2>Do your definitions favor one political side?</h2>
  <p>No. Our goal is to describe each ideology as accurately and fairly as possible, based on its core principles, not how it's perceived by opponents or popular media. We avoid framing any position as inherently good or bad and instead focus on presenting each one in a way that its supporters would recognize and agree with.</p>

  <h2>What if I disagree with your definition of a term?</h2>
  <p>That’s completely valid—political language is often contested. If you disagree, we encourage you to check the explanation provided and consider the sources and reasoning behind it. We're always open to constructive feedback and will continue refining our definitions to improve clarity, fairness, and accuracy.</p>

  <h2>Are these definitions fixed, or do they evolve over time?</h2>
  <p>The core ideas behind each political identity are relatively fixed, rooted in long-standing philosophical traditions. However, the subcategories and expressions of these ideologies can shift over time, across cultures, and even between generations. We aim to preserve the foundational meaning while adapting to relevant context when necessary.</p>
  
  <h2>Why not just use dictionary definitions?</h2>
  <p>While dictionaries are helpful for general use, they often lack the depth needed to capture the full ideological and historical meaning of political terms. Many definitions are simplified, shaped by modern usage, or influenced by popular discourse. We go beyond surface-level meanings to explore the philosophical roots, historical context, and intended function of each term within political theory.</p>
    
  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions About ETHOS as a Company</h1>

  <h2>Is ETHOS affiliated with any political group or party?</h2>
  <p>No. ETHOS is completely independent and not affiliated with any political group, party, or organization. The ETHOS test is designed to be politically neutral and independent. It isn’t influenced by any party or agenda. Our goal is to create a balanced tool that fairly represents all major ideologies, based on philosophy and historical context—not partisan messaging.</p>
    
  <h2>Is ETHOS a non-profit?</h2>
  <p>ETHOS is not officially registered as a non-profit, but our goals are educational and nonpartisan. We prioritize clarity, accuracy, and public understanding over profit, and we aim to keep our tools freely accessible.</p>
  
  <h2>Will ETHOS collect or sell my data?</h2>
  <p>We don’t collect any data beyond what’s strictly necessary for the site to function. We never sell your information, and we prioritize privacy at every level of development.</p>
  
  <h2>Why did you create ETHOS instead of using existing tests?</h2>
  <p>We found that most existing political tests are overly simplistic, biased, or focused more on entertainment than accuracy. ETHOS was created to offer a more nuanced, balanced, and philosophically grounded alternative—one that respects complexity and encourages honest self-reflection.</p>
  
  <h2>What is ETHOS’s mission?</h2>
  <p>ETHOS aims to provide a deeper, more accurate understanding of political identity by going beyond simplistic labels and two-axis models. Our goal is to promote clarity, reduce bias, and encourage thoughtful reflection through a structured and philosophy-driven approach.</p>
    
  <h2>How can I suggest changes or report an issue?</h2>
  <p>We welcome feedback! If you spot an error, disagree with a definition, or have suggestions for improvement, you can reach out through our contact form or message us on social media. We’re always open to refining ETHOS to make it clearer, fairer, and more useful.</p>
